Sammy presented the on-going project SLICING  funded by the CMEMS-Service-Evolution program.
SLICING stands for Sea Level Innovations and Collaborative Intercomparisons for the Next-Generation products. 
It is a CMEMS - Service Evolution project that  builds collaborative data challenges for the next-generation sea level anomaly metrics, observation and mapping products.
This is a collaboration between Sammy Metref and Clément Ubelmann in Datlas (lead) with Maxime Ballarotta and Clément Busché from Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS), Ramonville St-Agne, France, and Maxime Beauchamp from IMT Atlantique Bretagne-Pays de la Loire, Brest, France.
