The meeting was held in Bergen, Norway (June 27-30) and gathered about 60 participants of 7 countries (France, US, New Zeland, UK, Norway, Germany, Italy) from all the institutions of the [SASIP](https://sasip-climate.github.io/) consortium.

The scientific program  can be browsed [here](https://cloud.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/s/PSZPaNqAf5fpj83) and  the recording of the presentations is available on a dedicated [Sasip Climate youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvzG0ke9xnX5_IQcMuSU93vZD5d5dfQ3-).

Stephanie co-animated with her colleague Aur√©lie Albert from IGE, France, a "Hands-on" session, based on a cloud plateform, on how to compute a simulation with the new sea ice model neXtSIM-DG being developped as part of the project.
