On Monday, December 16th, the Datlas team came together for a festive Christmas dinner at the restaurant **La belle idée**, located in downtown Grenoble. This special occasion coincided with the visit of Christine, our administrative and legal manager, who joined us for a day of productive and engaging meetings.  

Organized by Clément Ubelmann, the dinner brought together all Datlas members, including our recent arrivals, as well as colleagues from the MEOM team at IGE. The event provided a wonderful opportunity for informal discussions in a relaxed and cheerful atmosphere, strengthening human bonds among collegues.  

A big thank you to Clément for organizing this delightful gathering and to everyone who attended for making it such a memorable and enjoyable occasion. This dinner was a perfect way to end the year with a spirit of teamwork and camaraderie.
