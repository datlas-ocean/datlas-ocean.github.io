The SWOT mission is led by the French space agency CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales) and NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). 
The satellite is able to measure and survey water on over 90% of Earth’s surface, providing a high-resolution map of our planet’s water resources for the first time ever. 
The satellite’s measurements of freshwater and ocean masses are set to deliver new insights into the global ocean cycle impacted by climate change.
