This event is  hosted by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, in Oslo, Norway.

It is a  joint workshop of the International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG), the Norwegian Meteorological Institute, the EUMETSAT Ocean and Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF), the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative for Sea Ice (ESA CCI), and the Sea Ice Retrieval and Data Assimilation in Norway (SIRANO).
It is the 11th in a series organized with the International Ice Charting Working Group (IICWG), and it aims at improving international capabilities to perform sea ice prediction on timescales ranging from hours to a season. The aim of the workshop is to discuss cross-cutting issues in sea ice modelling, assimilation and observations and how deficiencies of current systems can be diagnosed and addressed more efficiently. 
General topics (sessions) include: 
* Sea ice data assimilation (methods and results) 
* Sea ice observations and uncertainties 
* Sea ice model parameterizations and coupling to ocean and atmosphere models 
* Verification approaches for sea ice analyses and forecasts
* Recent research to sea ice operation transferâ€”Automated prediction systems
