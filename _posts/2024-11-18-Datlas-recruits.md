We are delighted to welcome three new team members, each bringing their expertise to the forefront of geoscientific research in Datlas.  

**Laurine Fiol** joins us as an engineer dedicated to the CMEMS Service Evolution project **ARTIC-BLISS**. Laurine's work will focus on enhancing sea ice forecasting through atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) coupling. Her contributions will push the boundaries of predictive modeling, enabling more accurate and reliable insights into Arctic conditions—a critical endeavor as we navigate a warming climate.  

**Florian Le Guillou**, our new fellow research scientist, will spearhead research on ocean surface data processing and sensor synergy. Florian's expertise promises to bridge gaps between diverse data sources, ensuring that we extract maximum value from advanced observation technologies. His work will play a pivotal role in improving ocean surface dynamic reconstructions.  

**Antoine Blondel** comes aboard as an engineer to contribute to the **CNES Odysea project**. Antoine will focus on refining the calibration of the upcoming surface current Odysea satellite mission. This project is crucial for advancing the precision of ocean current observations, which are foundational to monitoring climate change and enhancing maritime operations.  

We’re thrilled to have Laurine, Florian, and Antoine join the Datlas team. Their expertise will strengthen our projects and help drive progress in geoscientific research and services.

Welcome aboard, Laurine, Florian, and Antoine —- we’re looking forward to working together!
